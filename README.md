# Wrangling and light analysis of Twitter data

As part of a project for Udacity I focussed on wrangling some data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. I then took on some light analysis, focussing on:

1. Top 10 predicted dog breeds
2. What tweet was retweeted the most?
3. Top 10 rated numerators
4. What tweet recieved the highest favourites?
5. What was the most common dog stage?
